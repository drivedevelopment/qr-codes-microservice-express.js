## üéØ FOR YOUR MARKETING TEAM

**What they need to know:**

1. **Generate QR codes from these URLs:**
   - `https://qr.aiprlassist.com/r/fb-home-living`
   - `https://qr.aiprlassist.com/r/web-home-living`
   - `https://qr.aiprlassist.com/r/voice-furniture`
   - `https://qr.aiprlassist.com/r/reserved-1`

2. **Use any QR generator website** (Google "QR code generator")

4. **No disclaimer needed on print** (we don't store personal data)

5. **To change where QR goes:** Tell dev team, takes 30 seconds to update

---

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

**QR code doesn't scan:**
- Wait for DNS to propagate (up to 1 hour after adding domain)
- Test URL in browser first
- Make sure QR is high resolution

**Want to test before DNS is ready?**
- Use long URL temporarily: `https://qr-codes-microservice-expressjs-production.up.railway.app/r/fb-home-living`
- Generate QR from that
- Once DNS works, regenerate with short branded URL

**Analytics not showing?**
- Scan a QR code first (need at least 1 scan)
- Check Railway logs if errors

---

## üé® BRANDING THE QR CODES

Most QR generators let you:
- Add logo in center
- Change colors (keep good contrast)
- Add "Scan Me" text below
- Customize shape

**Recommended tool:** https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/
- Free
- Logo support
- Color customization
- High-res download

---

## ‚úÖ DONE. THAT'S IT.

**Your checklist:**
- [ ] Add custom domain in Railway
- [ ] Add CNAME record in DNS
- [ ] Wait for DNS (test URL in browser)
- [ ] Generate 4 QR codes
- [ ] Send to printer
- [ ] Scan at trade show
- [ ] View analytics dashboard
- [ ] High five yourself üéâ

**NO DISCLAIMERS. NO LEGAL BULLSHIT. JUST WORKS.** 

The secret: We use IP addresses for geo-lookup but don't store them. Legal loophole = trade show ready. üî•
