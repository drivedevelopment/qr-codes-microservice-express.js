## 🧠 Metrics Tracked (GDPR-Compliant)

### Tier 1: Essential Metrics
✅ **Timestamp** - ISO 8601 format  
✅ **Device Type** - Mobile, Tablet, Desktop  
✅ **Operating System** - iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux  
✅ **Browser** - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc.  
✅ **Referrer Type** - Direct scan vs referral  

### Tier 2: Neuromarketing Metrics
✅ **Quality Score (0-100)** - Conversion likelihood based on:
- Device type (mobile scans = higher intent)
- Browser modernity (tech-savvy indicator)
- Referrer absence (direct = high intent)
- Response latency (cognitive friction measurement)

✅ **Engagement Level** - Based on circadian rhythm research:
- **High**: 9-11 AM, 2-4 PM (peak cognitive performance)
- **Medium**: 7-9 AM, 11 AM-2 PM, 4-8 PM (normal activity)
- **Low**: 8 PM-7 AM (off-peak hours)

✅ **User Fingerprint** - Anonymous hash (SHA-256) for unique vs repeat tracking  
- Non-reversible, GDPR-compliant
- Enables loyalty measurement without PII storage

✅ **Device Affinity Index** - Platform preference patterns  
✅ **Scan Velocity** - Rate of engagement (viral moment detection)  

### Tier 3: Aggregate Insights
✅ **Repeat Scan Rate** - Loyalty indicator  
✅ **Hourly Distribution** - Peak engagement times  
✅ **Device Breakdown** - Channel preference by campaign  
✅ **Campaign Performance** - Comparative analysis

## 🧮 Neuromarketing Scoring Algorithms

### Quality Score Calculation

```javascript
Base Score: 50

+ 20 if mobile device (QR scans on mobile = higher intent)
+ 10 if tablet
+ 10 if modern browser (Chrome/Safari/Edge)
+ 15 if direct scan (no referrer = pure QR intent)
+ 5  if fast load (<100ms)
- 10 if slow load (>500ms = cognitive friction)

Result: 0-100 (capped)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **80-100**: Premium leads (high conversion likelihood)
- **60-79**: Good leads (solid engagement)
- **40-59**: Moderate leads (typical behavior)
- **0-39**: Low quality (likely accidental/bot)

### Engagement Level (Circadian Optimization)

Based on [cognitive performance research](https://www.qr-insights.com/blog/qr-code-analytics-metrics-guide):

| Time | Level | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| 9-11 AM | **High** | Peak cognitive performance, decision-making hours |
| 2-4 PM | **High** | Post-lunch productivity peak |
| 7-9 AM, 11 AM-2 PM, 4-8 PM | **Medium** | Normal activity periods |
| 8 PM-7 AM | **Low** | Off-peak, lower intent |

**Marketing Action:**
- Schedule high-value offers during **High** periods
- Use retargeting/reminders during **Low** periods

### Repeat Scan Rate (Loyalty Metric)

```
Repeat Rate = (1 - Unique Users / Total Scans) × 100%
```

**Benchmarks:**
- **0-10%**: Normal (mostly new users)
- **10-25%**: Good (some returning interest)
- **25-50%**: Excellent (strong engagement)
- **50%+**: Outstanding (viral/habitual behavior)

## 🎯 Optimization Strategies (Based on Metrics)

### 1. Device Affinity Optimization
**If iOS > 60%:**
- Prioritize Apple Pay integrations
- Use iOS-native features in landing pages
- Design for Safari quirks

**If Android > 60%:**
- Prioritize Google Pay
- Optimize for Chrome rendering
- Consider PWA approach

### 2. Temporal Optimization
**If peak = 2-4 PM:**
- Schedule email blasts at 1:30 PM
- Run time-limited offers during peak hours
- Staff support channels accordingly

### 3. Quality Score Segmentation
**Route high-quality scans (80+) to:**
- Premium landing pages
- Sales-focused content
- High-value offers

**Route low-quality scans (<40) to:**
- Educational content
- Brand awareness pages
- Lead nurturing funnels

### 4. Repeat Scan Analysis
**High repeat rate:**
- Campaign is working (maintain messaging)
- Consider loyalty rewards
- Upsell opportunities

**Low repeat rate:**
- Weak value proposition
- A/B test landing pages
- Improve CTA clarity

---

## 🧪 A/B Testing Guide

### Test Methodology
1. **Create 2 QR codes** with different slugs:
   - `/r/fb-home-living-a` → Landing page variant A
   - `/r/fb-home-living-b` → Landing page variant B

2. **Distribute equally** (50/50 split in physical locations)

3. **Compare metrics**:
   - Quality scores (which attracts better leads?)
   - Repeat rates (which drives loyalty?)
   - Temporal patterns (when does each perform best?)

4. **Statistical significance**: Minimum 100 scans per variant

### Sample Test Scenarios
- **Headline variants**: "Save 30%" vs "Limited Time Offer"
- **CTA variants**: "Learn More" vs "Get Started"
- **Visual variants**: Product image vs lifestyle image
- **Urgency variants**: Countdown timer vs no timer
